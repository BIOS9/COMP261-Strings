Brute force algorithm takes O(mn) time where m is the length of the data and n is the length of the pattern
KMP takes O(m + n) where m is the length of the data and n is the n is the length of the pattern. m time is taken to search the string, n time is taken to generate the pattern table

in KMP the index in the data never moves backwards.

lps
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9  10 11 12
a b c d x a b d y a  b  c  a
0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 1  2  3  1

put position + 1 in the lps table, which is the point to start the next comparison from because it can skip position
When character is mismatched, the prefix index jumps to the position notated in the previous slot, not 0.

To build lps table:

```
let i = 1
let j = 0

let pattern = string to search for
let table = array with length of pattern string, initialized to empty or 0

initialize first slot in table to 0 if not already done

while (i < length of table)
    if (pattern[i] equals pattern[j])
        table[i] = j + 1
        i = i + 1
        j = j + 1
    else
        if (j equals 0)
            table[i] = 0;
            i = i + 1
        else
            j = table[j - 1]
        end if
    end if
end while
```

to search using the table

```
let data = data string in which to search for pattern

let i = 0 // Index in the data to search, never goes backwards
let j = 0 // Index in the pattern to search for

let pattern = string to search for
let table = pattern prefix table

while (i < length of data)
    if (data[i] equals pattern[j])
        i = i + 1
        j = j + 1

        if (j equals length of pattern - 1)
            match found at i - j
            either return result here,
            or j = table[j - 1] // j cannot return to start in case pattern can occur intersecting with itself e.g pattern "aaa" might
        end if
    else
        if (j equals 0)
            i = i + 1
        else
            j = table[j - 1]
        end if
    end if
end while

return no match if not already returned
